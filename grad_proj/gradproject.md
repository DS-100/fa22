## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The graduate project is offered only to students enrolled in Data C200 or CS C200A. Other students are welcome to explore the questions and datasets in the project for learning, but their work will not be graded or counted towards their final grades.

The purpose of the project is to give students experience in both open-ended data science analysis and research in general. In this project, you will work with **one or any combination** of the following datasets provided to you to explore research questions that you define.

**Note**: in addition to the general guideline, each option has its own set of additional requirements for Report Format and Submission. Be sure to consult the correct section for your project option.

You will receive feedback from peer grading before the final deadline, and you are expected to incorporate the feedback into the final report and presentation. You will be graded on both the final report and presentation, as well as certain deliverables before the submission of the final reports, including your peer reviews.

**Teamwork**: You can work alone or in a group with **at most two other students**. If you are interested in working with others, we will have an Ed post for teammate search. Everyone in the same group will receive the same grade. The group size will be taken into consideration for grading.

## Datasets <a name="dataset"></a>

This section will contain the datasets we will provide to you to explore your research questions. Please note that:

- You must incorporate **at least one** of the provided datasets.
- You are welcome to **bring in additional datasets** to complement the datasets provided here, but you must cite the sources and clearly describe the content of any additional data you use in the final report.

The datasets will be released when the full project is released in April.
