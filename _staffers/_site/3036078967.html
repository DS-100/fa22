<p>Hey! Iâ€™m a second year CS+Stats major with a minor in History. I love hiking, cooking, reading, and (unfortunately) making terrible puns. I really enjoyed Data 100 when I took it, so super excited to meet you all and help make this class great for you! Talk to me about getting involved in research, education, hikes in/around Berkeley, or anything at all :-))  (and if you want to be my best friend, send me book/recipe suggestions)</p>
