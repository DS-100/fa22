<p>My major is Data Science and I transferred to Cal from san Diego City College in Fall 2020, everything was remote then too, the sky was orange. Data 100 has been the most interesting class I have taken at Cal, make sure to find friends to work with on the first day or sooner, and ask us for a lot of help.</p>
