<p>Hey! I am a junior, CS major from Mumbai, India. Besides CS, my interests include music (I play the guitar, Iâ€™m mostly into rock) and squash. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about CS experience at Cal (including and beyond coursework), international student experience, any personal problems, or anything you feel I can help with.</p>
