    "#### Matplotlib meets Pandas meets Regular Expressions to do some basic exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will simulate the EDA process with a dataset you've seen a million times (`babynames`), giving you an opportunity to practice scouring data for interesting patterns using techniques you're already familiar with (Pandas, regular expressions, Matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `babynames` dataset, you will be first be asked to consider and discuss a variety of factors to obtain some baseline understanding of the dataset (types of column variables, how many observations, granularity or level of each observation, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've obtained a baseline understanding, try to find some interesting trend/pattern/finding in the dataset, and then produce some graphical display of your finding! We have a list of potentially interesting trends to look for in case you get stuck, but if you or your group members think of something else, pursue it! If you want to go all-out with visualization, feel free to do so, but note visualization techniques will be emphasized more next week."
