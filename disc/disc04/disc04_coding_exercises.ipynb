Most doubt it's existence, but a passionate few swear that bigfoot is real. In this discussion, you will be working with a dataset on bigfoot sightings, visualizing variable distributions and combinations thereof to better understand how/when/where bigfoot is reportedly spotted, and possibly either confirm or cast doubt on its existence."
