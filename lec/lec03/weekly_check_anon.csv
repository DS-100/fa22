114,Turtle,68.0,"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson decide to go on a camping trip.
After dinner and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night, and go to sleep.
Some hours later, Watson awoke and nudged his faithful friend.
""Holmes, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.""
Holmes replied, ""I see millions of stars.""
""What does that tell you?""
Sherlock says
""Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.""
""Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo.""
""Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three.""
""Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant.""
""Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.""
""What does it tell you, Watson?""
Watson was silent for a minute, then spoke: ""Holmes, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!"
