# Quick Guide to LaTeX

LaTeX is a typesetting system that creates beautiful scientific documents. You can still submit handwritten homeworks, but we recommend using LaTeX.

Here are some resources on LaTeX to help you get started. There are many excellent tutorials on LaTeX online as well, but we've compiled some of our own so you can see how mathmatical notation works.

+ [An Introduction to LaTeX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF3E2ZOom1o){:target="_blank"}: Youtube tutorial by Benson Kung, Stanford's CS109 TA
+ See these [installation instructions](web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1212/handouts/latex/install.pdf){:target="_blank"} PDF, and the [LaTeX code](web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1212/handouts/latex/install.tex){:target="_blank"} used to generate it. We highly suggest using an online LaTeX editor like [https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/){:target="_blank"}, but you may also install LaTeX locally on your machine. We've included instructions for both online and local setup.
+ See a more involved math example and play around with this [example LaTeX code](web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1212/handouts/latex/example.tex){:target="_blank"} ([generated PDF](web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1212/handouts/latex/example.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

## LaTeX cheat sheets

Here is an excellent [LaTeX cheat sheet](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/mbailly/Comm_Scientifique/docs/latexsheet.pdf){:target="_blank"} that you can reference.

## Adding Homework Templates to Overleaf

+ Download the homework template file (with extension ending in .zip) from the course website. You do not need to open/extract these files.
+ On the Overleaf website (register with your berkeley.edu account), go to "New Project" -&gt; "Upload Project".

<center> <img src="../resources/assets/other/overleaf1.png" alt="A screenshot of part of the Overleaf home website, where Upload project (under New Project) is highlighted." width="300"/>
</center>

+ Navigate to the correct .zip file and confirm. The zip file will upload.

<center> <img src="../resources/assets/other/overleaf2.png" alt="overleaf screenshot" width="400"/>
</center>

+ Overleaf will automatically extract this zip and create a new Overleaf project.
