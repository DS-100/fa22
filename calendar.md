## Office Hours Calendar

In-person office hours are in <span style="color:red">**red**</span>, while virtual office hours are in <span style="color:orange">**orange**</span>. Click on each event to see which GSI and/or tutor is running each office hour time. You should come to these with questions about anything – labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc.

To access in-person office hours, go to the room in the location of the office hour slot you're planning on attending.

To access virtual office hours, go to our [Office Hours Queue](http://oh.ds100.org). When it’s your turn, you will be given the Zoom link to join.

Instructor office hours with Josh and Lisa appear in <span style="color:#795548">**brown**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts. To access instructor office hours, use the Zoom links posted on Piazza. If you would like to meet with the instructors and none of these times work for you, please reach out to us privately.
