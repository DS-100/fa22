## Office Hours Calendar

In-person office hours are in <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span>, while virtual office hours are in <span style="color:brown">**brown**</span>. Click on each event to see which GSI and/or reader is running each office hour time. You should come to these with questions about anything â€“ labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc. 

**Note: If you are attending online office hour, note that there is limited staff online and the wait time is usually much longer than in-person options at the same time.**

To access in-person office hours, go to the room in the location of the office hour slot you're planning on attending.

To access virtual office hours, place your ticket on the [queue](http://oh.ds100.org/) and then join the call with the "Join Call" button when your name is pulled.

Instructor office hours with Fernando and Will appear in <span style="color:red">**red**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts.
