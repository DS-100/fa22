## Office Hours Calendar

In-person office hours are in <span style="color:green">**green**</span>, while virtual office hours are in <span style="color:brown">**brown**</span>. Click on each event to see which GSI and/or tutor is running each office hour time. You should come to these with questions about anything â€“ labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc.

To access in-person office hours, go to the room in the location of the office hour slot you're planning on attending.

To access virtual office hours, go to our [Office Hours Zoom](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/97379426810?pwd=TnRBdnRKYjVEd1pVaGQ1Y3hJaTk5dz09) and join the breakout room of the question you are working on.

Instructor office hours with Josh and Lisa appear in <span style="color:red">**red**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts. To access instructor office hours, use the Zoom links posted on Ed. If you would like to meet with the instructors and none of these times work for you, please reach out to us privately.
